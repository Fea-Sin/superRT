## Build Setup

If you do not use Yarn, you'll first need to install it on your system.

There are a offical way to instal Yarn, you just go [install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)

```bash
# install dependenceies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn start

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# run tests
yarn test
```

Or, you can just use npm

```bash
# install dependenceies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run tests
npm run test
```

## 项目需求
